# Chapters
A macOS app for splitting PDFs into smaller PDFs based on their outline/table of contents.

# How To Use
1. Either select File > Open from the menu-bar or use the shortcut &#8984;O to open a new PDF file to split.
2. Review how the PDF will be split before saving by previewing each section's PDF.
3. Click the save button.

# Structured Output
By default, the PDF will be split into smaller PDFs which will be saved in a directory tree that reflects the outline of the PDF.
If you would instead like to have all of the smaller PDFs dumped into a single folder, uncheck this option.
